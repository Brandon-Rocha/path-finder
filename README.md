# path-finder
Implement a path finding agent traveling from
point to point in a two-dimensional grid world using breadth-first search (BFS),
depth-first search (DFS), greedy best-first search (GBFS), and A* search. In this project, the environment is the grid world, represented by a
grid with certain number of row lines and column lines, where we call each intersection a point.
The agent will start at a source point to find a path through other points to reach the
destination point. At any point in time, the agent only is allowed to act along the lines in one
of four directions: up, right, down, and left.
